                    Rockbert is a discord bot I programmed that you can play Rock Paper Scissors with.
                    It also allows you to play with another person. I wrote it in Python. Currently it generates what it's going to play randomly,
                    but I might, in the future, make an AI that chooses what the bot chooses.

                    My Sudoku Game is an unfinished project. It is written in ASP.NET. I used Object Oriented Programming, 
                    but I don't like how I organized the board. This was my first time using ASP.NET and my first time using Microsoft's .NET Framework.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Gibs Browser was my first time using WinForms, part of .NET Framework. It was also my second time using Microsoft's .NET Framework.
                    I wanted to make a browser that was simple to use, had most of the functionality of a normal browser, and I could customize the basic GUI.
                    I liked certain parts of Opera GX, like the sidebar, so I tried to implement that into my browser. I got it to minimally work, but in a not super smooth way.
