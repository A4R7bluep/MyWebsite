                My name is Ross Gibson. I am currently a Junior at Assabet Valley Regional Technical High School.
                I am in the Computer Programming and Web Development shop. I enjoy programming.
                I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I am currently trying to get better at C# and
                using Microsoft's .NET Framework. I have used WinForms and ASP.NET.
                I am looking for an internship in the Computer Programming or Web Development field.

                    Rockbert is a Rock Paper Scissors Discord bot I programmed.
                    It also allows you to play with another user or you vs. the bot. I wrote it in Python. It chooses what
                    to play randomly.

                    It is written in ASP.NET. I used Object Oriented Programming. 
                    I learned a lot about C# and how to orgranize code.
                    This was my first time using ASP.NET and my first time using Microsoft's .NET Framework.
                    I wanted to make a Sudoku game in ASP.NET because I wanted to learn how to use it and
                    I had an idea on how to make it work. After I had started work on it, I realized that my idea
                    would not work out. It's an project better made in WinForms.

                    Gibs Browser was my first time using WinForms. I wanted to make a browser that was simple to use,
                    had most of the functionality of a normal browser, and I could customize the basic GUI.
                    I like certain parts of Opera GX, like the sidebar, so I tried to implement that into my browser.
                    I used CefSharp to display the webpage, which is a .NET wrapper for the Chromium browser.
                    It's not finished enough for other people to use it, but it's a good start.
